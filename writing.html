    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <p>I specialize in writing about music and collaborating with artists on their bios, press kits, PR and the like. I'm an interview junkie and love to talk to artists about what they do and why they do it; I'm slowly chipping away at a book-length oral history project about DIY touring.</p>
